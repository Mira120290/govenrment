                <h3>President</h3>
                <p>The president of the Philippines is the country's chief executive, serving as the head of state and head of government.
                The president heads all executive departments. The heads of the departments, which make up the cabinet, are appointed by
                the president subject to the approval of the Commission on Appointments. The president also supervises all local
                government units. The president may also give executive issuances, grant pardons, and exercise the power of eminent
                domain. Aside from having the power to veto any bill, the president also sets the legislative agenda for Congress.</p>

                <h3>Vice president </h3>
                <p>The vice president of the Philippines, the deputy chief executive, is the first in line for succession if the president
                resigns, is removed after impeachment, is permanently incapacitated, or dies. The vice president is usually, though not
                always, a member of the president's cabinet and may be appointed without the approval of the Commission of Appointments.
                </p>
                <p>If there is a vacancy in the position of vice president, the president will appoint any member of Congress (usually a
                party member) as the new vice president. The appointment must then be validated by a three-fourths vote of the
                Congress.</p>
