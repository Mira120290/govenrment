                <p>The Judicial branch holds the power to settle controversies involving rights that are legally demandable and enforceable.
                This branch determines whether or not there has been a grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of
                jurisdiction on the part and instrumentality of the government. It is made up of a Supreme Court and lower courts.</p>
                
                ,<P>The Constitution expressly grants the Supreme Court the power of Judicial Review as the power to declare a treaty,
                international or executive agreement, law, presidential decree, proclamation, order, instruction, ordinance or
                regulation unconstitutional.</p>

                <p>The Judiciary Branch makes up by the Chief Justice, different associate justices, and different prosecutors from
                different regional and metropolitan trial courts. The Sandiganayan, and the Court of Tax Appeals are also part of the
                Judiciary. </p>
                
                <p>They are the ones who question the constitutionality of the laws passed by the legislative. Likewise, they are the ones
                who impose a temporary restraining order that will legally stop activities based on different complaints made by the
                complainant. Also, the Supreme Court can overturn any decision made by the different trial courts. However, such matters
                are needed investigation and technicalities required by law. A Chief Justice is indeed appointed by the President.</p>

                <p>The judicial power is vested in the Supreme Court of the Philippines and lower courts established by law. The Supreme
                Court, which has a chief justice as its head and 14 associate justices, occupies the highest tier of the judiciary. The
                justices serve until the age of 70. The justices are appointed by the president on the recommendation of the Judicial
                and Bar Council of the Philippines.[3] The sitting chief justice is Alexander Gesmundo, the 27th to serve in that
                position.</p>
