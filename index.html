                <p> The government of the Philippines (Filipino: Pamahalaan ng Pilipinas) has three interdependent branches: the
                legislative, executive, and judicial branches. The Philippines is governed as a unitary state under a presidential
                representative and democratic constitutional republic in which the president functions as both the head of state and the
                head of government of the country within a pluriform multi-party system.
                
                The powers of the three branches are vested by the Constitution of the Philippines in the following: Legislative power
                is vested in the two-chamber Congress of the Philippines—the Senate is the upper chamber and the House of
                Representatives is the lower chamber.[1] Executive power is exercised by the government under the leadership of the
                president. Judicial power is vested in the courts, with the Supreme Court of the Philippines as the highest judicial
                body.</p>

                <a href="legislative.html"><img src="gavel.png" alt="LEGISLATIVE" width="100" HEIGHT="100"></a><br>
                <p> The Legislative branch is authorized to make laws, alter, and repeal them through the power vested in the Philippine
                Congress. This institution is divided into the Senate and the House of Representatives.</p>

                <h3>Executive Branch</h3>
                <a href="executive.html"><img src="palace.png" alt="executive" width="100" HEIGHT="100"></a><br>
                <p> The Executive branch is composed of the President and the Vice President who are elected by direct popular vote and
                serve a term of six years. The Constitution grants the President authority to appoint his Cabinet. These departments
                form a large portion of the country’s bureaucracy.</p>

                <h3>Judiciary Branch</h3>
                <a href="judiciary.html"><img src="scale.png" alt="judiciary" width="100" HEIGHT="100"></a><br>
                <p> The Judicial branch holds the power to settle controversies involving rights that are legally demandable and
                enforceable. This branch determines whether or not there has been a grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or
                excess of jurisdiction on the part and instrumentality of the government. It is made up of a Supreme Court and lower
                courts.</p>
