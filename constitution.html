                <p>The Constitution of the Philippines (Filipino: Saligang Batas ng Pilipinas or Konstitusyon ng Pilipinas) is the
                constitution or the supreme law of the Republic of the Philippines. Its final draft was completed by the Constitutional
                Commission on October 12, 1986, and ratified by a nationwide plebiscite on February 2, 1987.</p>
                
                <P>Three other constitutions have effectively governed the country in its history: the 1935 Commonwealth Constitution, the
                1973 Constitution, and the 1986 Freedom Constitution.</P>
                
                <P>The earliest constitution establishing a "Philippine Republic", the 1899 Malolos Constitution, was never fully
                implemented throughout the Philippines and did not establish a state that was internationally recognized, due in great
                part to the eruption of the Philippine–American War.</p>

            <p>The opening text introduces the constitution and the people as the source of sovereignty. It follows past constitutions,
            including an appeal to God. The preamble reads:</p>
            <em>We, the sovereign Filipino people, imploring the aid of Almighty God, in order to build a just and humane society and
            establish a Government that shall embody our ideals and aspirations, promote the common good, conserve and develop our
            patrimony, and secure to ourselves and our posterity the blessings of independence and democracy under the rule of law
            and a regime of truth, justice, freedom, love, equality, and peace, do ordain and promulgate this Constitution.</em>

                of the U.S. Constitution. Some essential provisions are:</p>

                <h3>Article IV – Citizenship</h3>
                <p>Article IV defines the citizenship of Filipinos. It enumerates two kinds of citizens: natural-born citizens and
                naturalized citizens. Natural-born citizens are those who are citizens from birth without having to perform any act to
                acquire or perfect Philippine citizenship. The Philippines follows a jus sanguinis system where citizenship is mainly
                acquired through a blood relationship with Filipino citizens.
                
                Natural-born citizenship forms an important part of the political system as only natural-born Filipinos are eligible to
                hold high offices, including all elective offices beginning with a representative in the House of Representatives up to
                the President.</p>
