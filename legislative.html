                <p>The Legislative branch is authorized to make laws, alter, and repeal them through the power vested in the Philippine
                Congress. This institution is divided into the Senate and the House of Representatives.</p>

                <p>The legislative power is vested in the Congress of the Philippines. The Congress is bicameral, consisting of the Senate
                of the Philippines and the House of Representatives. The two chambers have roughly equal powers, and every bill or
                resolution that has to go through both houses needs the consent of both chambers before being passed for the president's
                signature. The upper house is located in Pasay, while the lower house is located in Quezon City; both are in Metro
                Manila.</p>

                <h3>House of Representatives</h3>

                <p>The House of Representatives of the Philippines is the lower house of the Congress. The House consists of district and
                sectoral representatives elected for a term of three years and may be re-elected for three consecutive terms. Each bill
                has to be approved by the House, after which it is sent to the Senate. Furthermore, all franchise and money bills must
                originate from the lower house. The House of Representatives also has the power to impeach certain officials.
                
                The House of Representatives is headed by the speaker of the House of Representatives. The current speaker is Martin
                Romualdez.</p>

                <h3>Senate</h3>
            <p>The Senate of the Philippines is the upper house of the Congress. Senators are elected for a term of six years; they can
                be re-elected but may not run for a third consecutive term. Once a bill is approved by the House of Representatives, it
                is passed to the Senate. A bill must first be approved by the Senate in order to be passed for the president's signature
                to become a law. Only the Senate can concur with treaties and try impeachment cases.
                
                The Senate is led by the president of the Senate. The current Senate president is Migz Zubiri.</p>
